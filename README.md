# Overview

Our dataset consists of tweets made between January 1, 2020 - September 30, 2020 from a panel of 1.6 million Twitter users whose accounts are linked to public U.S. voter records. During this time window, 783,697 panel members were active and collectively made 284,581,223 tweets. Using the keywords lists included in the **keywords** folder, all tweets are classified as being about COVID-19, about Black Lives Matter, about neither or about both.

In order to preserve the privacy of our Twitter panel, raw data are not available. We have shared processed/aggregated data here along with the code for making the final tables and visualizations.
